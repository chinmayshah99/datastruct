# Question of Curiosity

1. Why appropriate selection of data structure is important in computer programming?

The resources of computer are usually limited and time is finite. So selecting appropriate data structure is a important part in development cycle. 


2. What are the basic steps one should follow for appropriate data structure selection?

a)	Understand the given problem
b)	Find the constraints that needs to be dealt with
c)	Find the appropriate data structure with doing trade-off between time and space. 


3. Give any one example (piece of code) demonstrating the effect of appropriate and inappropriate data structure selection

Appropriate: 
float  a=10.0;
Inappropriate: 
int a=’zz’;
